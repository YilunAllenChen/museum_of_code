  Lua is a lightweight, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. It is cross-platform, and is designed to be extensible and embeddable.

  It is arguably the fastest scripting language in the world, and has a very small set of reserved keywords, making it easy to learn.

  You can find Lua in many places, including the World of Warcraft game engine, the Roblox game engine, and the Redis database.
