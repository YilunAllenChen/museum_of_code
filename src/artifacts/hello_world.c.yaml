  The favorite language of systems programmers, C is a low-level language that is used to write operating systems, compilers, and other programs that require direct access to the computer's hardware.

  It is almost always a requirement for computer science majors to take a course in C programming, because of its logical affinity with the underlying hardware. If you understand C, you understand how a computer works.
