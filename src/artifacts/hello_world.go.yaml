  Go was designed to be "the modern C/C++", and is known
  for its speed and simplicity. It is widely used in
  the industry, and is the language of choice for
  many cloud-based applications.

  Its concurrency primitives make it easy to write
  programs that can harness the full power of modern
  multi-core processors, and it compiles extremely
  quickly thanks to cutting-edge dependency analysis research.
