  Ranked the most loved language by StackOverflow users for the past 6 years
  in a row, Rust is a systems programming language that is designed to be
  safe, blazingly fast, productive and still maintain the low-level control
  that C and C++ provide.

  Inspired by the likes of Haskell and ML, Rust also has a powerful type system
  and supports functional programming paradigms. Although it is a relatively
  young language, it has already been used in production by many companies, and
  even in the Linux kernel itself.
