  Haskell is a purely functional programming language, which means that it is based on functions and not on objects or statements like most other languages. It is also a lazy language, which means that it only evaluates expressions when it needs to.

  Although Haskell is not used as much in industry, it is truly a beautiful, inspirational, and thought-provoking language that challenges the way you think about programming.
