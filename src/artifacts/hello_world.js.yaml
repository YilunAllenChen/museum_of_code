  The modern internet would not be possible without JavaScript.
  It is the language of the web, and is used to make web pages
  interactive and dynamic.

  You'll find it surprising that JavaScript was originally
  designed in just 10 days, and was originally intended to be
  a simple scripting language for web pages. Today, it is
  a developer favorite, and its reach extends far beyond
  the web browser.
