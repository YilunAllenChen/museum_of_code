  How many times have you run into a division by zero error?

  This function is a safe version of the division operator. It returns a `None` value if the denominator is zero, and a `Some` value otherwise. 
  
  This concept of an `Option` type signals to the user that the function may fail, and they should explicitly handle the case where the denominator is zero.
