  OCaml is a popular choice for people who want to learn functional
  programming. Unlike other languages, Ocaml has very few parentheses
  and brackets, which almost makes it look like plain English.

  However, it is ridiculously expressive, very fast, and has a
  powerful type system that can catch many errors at compile time.
