  Dart is a modern, object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected programming language that runs on the Dart VM and can be transpiled to JavaScript. It is designed to be fast, easy to learn, and scalable to large applications.

  It is also the language of choice if one wants to develop Flutter applications - a cross-platform mobile application framework that allows one to develop Android and iOS applications using a single codebase.
