  Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed around developer productivity and happiness, and has a clean and expressive syntax that is easy to read and write.

  Like Python, Ruby is a great language for beginners, and is still used by many professional developers today.
